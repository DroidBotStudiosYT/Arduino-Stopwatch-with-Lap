# Arduino-Stopwatch-with-Lap-Function

This is a little gadget that wwas an add on to other common Arduino Stopwatches, the reason is, I added a Lap function. 

# Components

Arduino Uno

Liquid Crystal Display (16 pins)

10k Potentiometer 

4 Push Button Switches

A lot of Male to Male Jumperwires

830 tie-point breadboard, 400 tie works fine but for more space, the 830 is recommended

# How to get set up

Download the `ZIP` file and save it into your documents, after downloading, extract the `ZIP` file, if you haven't downloaded the Arduino IDE, then you should. After that, go to the `stopwatch.ino` file inside the extracted `ZIP` file that you downloaded, open the `ino` file, and upload it to your Arduino Uno, and you should be good to go with the code.

The circuit diagram is in the `circuit` page, just open it, then download the `jpg` file. (at least it should be `jpg`) Follow the circuit diagram and wire your cirucit.
